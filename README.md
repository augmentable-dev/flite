# flite

`flite` is a SQLite extension and command line utility for working with local data files.
It's meant to work in tandem with built-in functionality such as the [SQLite JSON1 extension](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html).

## Usage

### SQLite Extension

`flite` can be compiled to a shared library and be loaded as a SQLite [runtime extension](https://sqlite.org/loadext.html).
Run `make` and the shared library will available be at `./build/flite.so`.

### Command Line Interface

`make` will also produce a binary at `./build/flite`.

## lines

`lines` is an [eponoymous-only virtual table](https://www.sqlite.org/vtab.html#eponymous_only_virtual_tables) (table-valued-function) that reads a file from disk (or stdin if no file is specified) by line.

```sql
SELECT * FROM lines("/path/to/some/file.ndjson")
```

## readfile

`readfile` is a scalar function that returns the contents of a file (path provided as an argument).
If no path is supplied, it reads from stdin.

```sql
SELECT readfile("/path/to/file.json")
```

## yaml_to_json

`yaml_to_json` is a scalar function that expects a single argument (a YAML string) and returns it as a JSON string (which can be used in the built-in JSON methods)

```sql
SELECT yaml_to_json("hello: world")
-- {"hello":"world"}
```

## json_to_yaml

`json_to_yaml` is a scalar function that expects a single argument (a JSON string) and returns it as a YAML string.

```sql
SELECT json_to_yaml('{"hello":"world"}')
-- hello: world
```
